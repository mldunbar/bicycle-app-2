<h3 class="subtitle">Laws</h3>

<ul class="laws">
  <li>Bicycles in bike lanes have the right of way: Cars should not block your lane, even when turning at intersections.</li>
  <li>Bicycles should be in the bike lane unless there is an obstruction. </li>
  <li>Bicycles are allowed on roadways where lanes donâ€™t exist, but must ride as far right as possible, unless another lane provides the only path for a cyclist to continue on their route.</li>
  <li>Bicycles riding at night must have a white headlight and a red rear reflector.</li>
  <li>Cyclists must indicate turns.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="subtitle">Suggestions</h3>

<ul class="ideas">
  <li>Helmets are not required, but prevent major brain damage and death.</li>
  <li>When wearing headphones, only one ear is suggested. Hearing is the strongest advantage cyclists have above cars.</li>
</ul>
