# Ride and Rack

http://mldunbar.github.io/bicycle-app-2/

This app is an interactive mapping system for safe cycling in Greenville, SC.

It shows bicycle rack locations in a main map where users can add new markers and information, a map of places to rent bicycles, a page of public notes and a link to the local bCycle page.

Ride and Rack uses Backbone.js as its framework with some jQuery and vanilla Javascript. Gmaps.js allows for map functionality. There is a Parse backend.
